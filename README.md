# Askit
AskIT is a platform designed to facilitate better communication between students, TAs and lecturers. The app aims to provide a space where students can ask questions and seek advice regarding course content from others in a seamless and organized manner. 

After logging in, there will be a forum to view questions, as well as ask questions for each course they are enrolled in. Students and TAs can ask questions and answer other students’ questions there. Professors can create and delete courses and add students to their respective courses. 

The use of Artificial Intelligence is to automatically generate a summary and tags for questions asked, the web app will look at the content of the question, and generate a summary and tags which makes it easier for others to search for this question. AI is also used to suggest to the user the most similar question when a user asks a question.
